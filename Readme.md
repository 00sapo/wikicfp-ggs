# WikiCFP - GGS

This is a borwser extension that adds GGS rankings to WikiCFP pages.

GGS rankings are rankings assinged to computer science conferences by a
spanish-italian academic consortium based on rankings from various sources.

Rankings are between 7 (best) and 0 (worst). Note that 0 is also used for
conferences that are not top and have too few data for a fair rating. More
details are available on the [GGS website](https://scie.lcc.uma.es:8443/).

Moreover, The extensions add links to Goggle Scholar and ScimagoJR queries.

When enabled, the extension add two columns to the conference list. If the
`GSS` column is `n/a`, it means that:
1. the cfp is for a journal
2. the conference is very bad
3. the conference was not matched because of wrong name in WikiCFP
4. the conference is new

In any of the above cases, I strongly suggest you to first check scholar, sjr
and GGS rankings via the provided links (you can click the `GGS` table header
to go the GGS website). If you do not find the conference/journal on these
databases, only publish if you really trust the organizers.
